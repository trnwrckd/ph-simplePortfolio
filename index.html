            <p class="paragraph">I am fascinated by so many things. Designing, for instance. From simple illustrations to web designing. Some people are gifted but not being one of them, I want to find out how much difference is actually made by putting an effort. <br>
            I am keen on Web Development. I've experience with Svelte and React. I have some experience in android development with Flutter. <br>
            Being a Machine Learning enthusiast, I spend a fair amount of my time working on my BSc thesis these days. I use Python3.0, scikit-learn and Tensorflow in my codes. <br>
            There is so much left to learn, and I have only now discovered that. <br>

                    I adore that this job is pushing me towards becoming a better designer. <br>
                    Before this I had no idea what it meant to manage both the personal and professional aspects of one's life and still be able to always deliver, under pressure.<br>
                    Yay, i guess. </p>
